## Recent Changelog:

### lolMiner 1.14
- Added Ethash Zombie mode for 4G Nvidia GPUs. Use --4g-alloc-size to calibrate the number of MBytes the GPUs are allowed to use. 
- Fixed a segmentation fault on Nvidia & mixed rigs when starting Ethash mining

### lolMiner 1.13
- Ethash: Reduced power draw significantly on  non-zombie mode for Rx Fury & Rx 470 - 590, slight reduction for Vega &  Navi
- Ethash: Slightly improved performance on Vega, Navi and Nvidia GPUs. Significantly improved performance on R9 390. (1)
- Added (Linux) Zombie mode for RX 5300XT & RX 5500 4G cards. Windows users can try it by using "--win4galloc off --4g-alloc-size 4008". (Vary the last number to find out sweet spot)
- Added ETCHash support for Radeon HD 79x0 / R9 280 (X) & RX 5300 3G. On Linux will be good for ETCHash till epoch ~250 (about July 2022) 
- Added caching of last 5 used light caches. This will reduce the switching time for Nicehash & ZIL dual mining significantly. 
- Added support for extranonce subscription on  EthereumStratum/1.0.0 (Nicehash) format - this will stop the miner from frequently reconnecting to Nicehash
- Added detection of pool not accepting worker name in <wallet.workerName> format when using ETHPROXY stratum. Miner will reconnect with worker name copied into --worker in this case. 
- Added experimental workaround for mining epoch 385+ with RX 470 - 590 and Linux kernel 5.6.x: Note this fix will deactivate the ZIL cache ability and force the miner to create DAG a bit slower. Deactivate it with --disableLinux56fix . Other Linux kernel versions and other GPUs are unchanged.
- Fixed bug: "conversion of data to type "b" failed" when using ETHPROXY stratum mode on some pools.
- Fixed potential issue causing GPUs to freeze when a GPU needs to reboot, e.g. epoch change or connection loss.
- Fixed benchmark mode for ETCHash. Use --benchmark ETCHASH --benchepoch 390 to benchmark performance post fork.
- Fixed benchmark mode not starting up when called from json type configuration.

(1)  (its still not perfect, but way better)


### lolMiner 1.12
- Added support for ETCHash (Ethereum Classic dag size reduction planned for end November). Use --algo ETCHASH to activate it. (See note on release page).
- Reworked Ethash codes for late epochs on Windows. See 4G_Windows_Readme.txt for configuring it.
- Slightly improved Ethash efficiency for GCN 3 (R9 Fury, 470 - 590) & Navi cards
- Added experimental support for Ethash on Nvidia GPUs (See note on release page)
- Added new parameter: --4g-alloc-size <MByte> to define the memory allowed for Ethash on 4G cards. Maxing out will give more epochs of mining & better Zombie mode performance, lower values may improve compatibility. Suggested values: Linux: 4076, Windows 4008 - 4024
- Added new parameter: --worker <Name> to set the worker in ETHPROXY stratum mode (improves pool compatibility)
- Overall new Ethash host size back end - hopefully improving stability of mining
- Fixed bug: Zombie mode generates defect shares in Windows
- Fixed bug: Logs were not written when "LOG" : 1 was set in json style config file



### lolMiner 1.0

- lolMiner got a restructure how to configure it and also features a 2nd, more simple config file format.
  Use lolMiner -h to get a list of new supported parameters or visit the new [online manual](https://github.com/Lolliedieb/lolMiner-releases/wiki)
- Added optimizes solvers for Beam Hash III for AMD & Nvidia cards. Use *--coin BEAM* to auto switch from BeamHash II to BeamHash III on fork (approx June 28th, requires 8G card) or select Beam Hash III solver manually with *--algo BEAM-III* (requires 6G card)
- Added performance improved (+ >10%) GRIN-C29M solver for 8G GPUs
- Added Cuckaroo-30 solver to mine Cortex Ai (*--coin CTXC* or *--algo C30CTX*) for all 8G and higher GPUs
- Added support for non-integer difficulty on Grin
- Reactivated support for Beam Hash I including support for personalization strings. 
- AMD Navi does now work on all supported algorithms
- Removed Grin Auto-Switcher (C31 is obsolete now and the switcher would not work on next Grin fork)
- Removed support for MNX (Minex Coin project is dead / abandoned by developers)  
- Added temperature, consumption and fan speed readings in API and long statistics
- Internal bug fixes

### lolMiner 0.9.8
- Improved GRIN-C29M solver, Better performance (+7-12% depending on card) and smaller memory use (fits 6G now)
- Added support for Radeon 5500 (XT) and 5600 (XT) on all Grin algorithms 
- Added BEAM support for Radeon 5500, 5600 and 5700 series (Needing 19.30 and newer driver)
- Fixed driver incompatibilities with some newer driver versions (e.g. Linux 19.50) 
- Renamed GRIN-AD29 to MWC-C29D to mine cuckarood-29
- Added a small penalty to C32 in auto switcher - it seems the solver has not perfect fidelity and the penalty will make it switch a bit later to cover this. Will hopefully be fixed in next version
- Removed 14 cycle fidelity from overview - new C29M solver does not output it properly.

### lolMiner 0.9.6
- Significant improvement on GRIN-C29M performance (+6-7% on 580 and Vega cards, +10% on Navi)
- Significant improvement on GRIN-C31 and GRIN-C32 solver (~ +6% on all AMD cards)
- Added a 16G GRIN-C32 solver (Approx 20% faster on Radeon VII, Vega FE and 570 16G)

### lolMiner 0.9.5
- Added support for Grin CuckarooM-29 (hard fork on Jan 16th) on 8G AMD GPUs, use --coin GRIN-C29M to mine with it.

- Navi on Windows now runs same kernels as in Linux
- Slightly lowered energy use of C31 / C32 solver
- Added aliases GRIN-C31 and GRIN-C32 for the Cuckatoo solvers (the old names still exist and continue to work)

### lolMiner 0.9.4

- Experimental support for Cuckatoo-32 (use --coin GRIN-AT32) on 8G AMD cards (see further notes on releases page)
- Windows release postponed due to incompatibilities with the new performance codes. 

### lolMiner 0.9.3
- Extended GRIN-AT31 compatibility to older drivers (18.x +) 
- Improved GRIN-AT31 performance on ROCm (RX 470/480/570/580/Vega/VII)

### lolMiner 0.9.2
- Significant performance improvement of GRIN-AT31 on 8 / 16G cards (+5% on Polaris & Vega, +10 on Navi)
- Experimental support for GRIN-AT31 and Polaris, Vega and VII using AMD ROCm drivers
- Added range checks to GRIN-AT31 code (improves better stability) 
- Added function to call external watchdog scripts in case a GPU fails during mining (see release notes)

### Usage of Watchdog Script
In case the miner detects no action of a GPU for at least a minute it will call the included scripts "reboot.sh" (Linux) or "reboot.bat" (Windows) and display a warning message in red. Afterwards the counters are reset. The scripts can be used to trigger a reboot of the rig or to call any other watchdog actions. The miner itself will take no further action and continue operation on the remaining cards.
